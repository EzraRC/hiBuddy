(WORK IN PROGRESS)

This app is a complete Network Enumeration Tool with a major focus on reconnaissance features. Hopefully, it will feature a GUI for ease of use so users will not have to memorize command lines. I am also using this app to practise my scripting and coding skills for cybersecurity, so feel free to reach out to me and help :)

## Setup
- Install Python
- Download and place all of the .py files in one folder.
- Launch the main.py file using an IDE of your choice.
- Have fun and learn well! :)

### How to Use
- Enter the number for the option that you would like to use
  - Example: Type '1' if you would like to use the Port Scan option.

## Features
- Port Scan
  - This feature identifies the states of ports ranging from 0 to 9999, listing if they are 'Open' or 'Filtered'. If the port number is not listed, we can assume that the port is closed (granted that the program works correctly).
